			Capture and Share <br>
			the World's Moments

		<p>
			Instagram is a <strong>fast, beautiful</strong> and <strong>fun</strong> way to share your life with friends and family.
			<br>
			Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram - it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.
			<br>
			Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
